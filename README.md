## The assignment brief

A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.

### Required user stories

- A user may view a list of Venues
- A user may search for a specific Venue
- A user may view a specific Venue page by id
- A user may view a calendar with available dates for a Venue
- A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register as a customer
- A registered customer may create a booking at a Venue
- A registered customer may view their upcoming bookings
- A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register as a Venue manager
- A registered Venue manager may create a Venue
- A registered Venue manager may update a Venue they manage
- A registered Venue manager may delete a Venue they manage
- A registered Venue manager may view bookings for a Venue they manage
- A registered user may login
- A registered user may update their avatar
- A registered user may logout

## The Process

I designed the user interface and wireframes using Figma, and subsequently developed a fully responsive website using Vite, Tailwind CSS and React. The website's data is fetched using NoroffÂ´s Rest API.
